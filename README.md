# DeepLearning_Projects
"  The project has two parts, focusing on two different facets of deep learning. The first one is to build a network that denoises using the PyTorch framework, in particular the torch.nn modules and autograd. The second one is to understand and build a framework, its constituent modules, that are the standard building blocks of deep networks without PyTorchâ€™s autograd."
